# minst-digit-recognizer
This project builds a simple neural network from scratch (without using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It uses:

A two-layer neural network: one hidden layer with ReLU activation, and an output layer with softmax activation for multiclass classification (digits 0â€“9).

Forward propagation to compute predictions and backpropagation to compute gradients and update weights using gradient descent.

Data normalization to improve training performance.

One-hot encoding for the output labels.

Accuracy tracking during training and visualization of how the model improves over time.

The model is trained on a large dataset of handwritten digits and then evaluated on a development set to check how well it generalizes.

File : digit-recognizer pt 2 has an accuracy of 88% 
File : digit-recognizer is a slower version of the above and has some bugs

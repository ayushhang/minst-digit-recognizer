# MNIST Digit Recognizer (Neural Network from Scratch)
This project builds a simple neural network from scratch (without using deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features
🧠 Two-layer Neural Network:

Hidden layer with ReLU activation

Output layer with Softmax activation

⚡ Forward Propagation and Backpropagation (manual gradient computation)

🛠️ Gradient Descent Optimization

📈 Training Accuracy Tracking and Visualization

📚 Clean, fully-commented code — great for learning!

Achieves ~88% accuracy on the MNIST development set.
